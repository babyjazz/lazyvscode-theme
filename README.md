## Installation 🚀

```bash
ext install lazyvscode-theme
```

Or install through the [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) or [Open VSX Registry](https://open-vsx.org/extension/babyjazz/lazyvscode-theme).

## ⚠️ Prerequisite: Custom CSS and JS Loader

This extension requires the [Custom CSS and JS Loader](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) extension to be installed and enabled in your VS Code. Please follow the instructions on the [marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=be5invis.vscode-custom-css) to set it up.


## Customization & Settings 🛠️

You can customize the theme and effects using the following settings in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    // Enable or disable the follow-cursor feature
    "babyjazz.follow-cursor": true,

    // Speed of the follow-cursor animation (ms)
    "babyjazz.follow-cursor-speed": 15,

    // Enable or disable the snow effect
    "babyjazz.is-enable-snow": false,

    // Enable or disable the cursor trail effect
    "babyjazz.is-enable-cursor-trail": false,

    // Duration of the cursor trail effect (ms)
    "babyjazz.cursor-trail-duration": 1500,

    // Enable or disable the pet: A BULGING EYES COW
    "babyjazz.is-enable-pet-a-bulging-eyes-cow": false,

    // Duration of the cursor smooth animation (ms)
    "babyjazz.cursor-smooth-duration": 150,

    // Easing function for cursor smooth animation
    "babyjazz.cursor-smooth-easing": "ease-out"
}
```

**Font Customization:**

The extension will automatically read `editor.fontFamily`, `editor.fontWeight`, `terminal.integrated.fontFamily`, and `terminal.integrated.fontWeight` from your `settings.json`. You can set these as you wish to override the defaults (such as Comic Sans):

```json
{
    "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
    "editor.fontWeight": "500",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono",
    "terminal.integrated.fontWeight": "500"
}
```

> ## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT: CURSOR SUPPORT ONLY**
> **This extension is fully supported only on the [Cursor](https://cursor.so) application.**
> **Some features may not work as expected in VS Code.**

<sub>I plan to test and fix bugs in VS Code in the future.</sub>
