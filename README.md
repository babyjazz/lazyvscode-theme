## Customization 🛠️

By default, this theme uses Comic Sans font for a unique coding experience. 
If you prefer a different font, you can override it in your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    // Override default Comic Sans font
    "editor.fontSize": 14,
    "editor.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono", // Change from Comic Sans to your preferred font
    "editor.fontLigatures": true,

    // Terminal font settings
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "JetBrains Mono" // Change from Comic Sans to your preferred font
}
```
